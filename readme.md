It is a type for text written in Guaran\'ed and Spanish. The main goal of its design is not reducing a culture to an aesthetic fact. The \'abpus\'f3\'bb, an inter vowel sign that the Guaran\'ed language uses similar to an apostrophe, was designed in consonance with the vowels and, from this sign, the diacritics (which Guaran\'ed heavily uses) were designed. The digraphs were created by pairs, instead of designing them as ligatures. Particular attention was paid to the diacritics design so they could have a great performance in languages where its use is frequent.\
